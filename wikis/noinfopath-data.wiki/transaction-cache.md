noTransactionCache service
--------------------------

  Each top-level property represents a crud operation that must
  be handled in a specific manner in order to ensure consistency.
  Within each operation is a list of NoTables that are part of the
  transaction.

  For each table in the operation are instructions as to which entity are
  involved, how to carry out the transaction, and in what order.


When a field is a string then the value will be the
property on the data object provider to the call
the `basic` preOp

When a field is an object then confgure as if the
value will be coming from a trusted provider like
scope, or $stateParams.

When `scope` is the provider then the directive scope is used.
Otherwise the supplied injecable provider will be used.

When field value is a primative type meaning not
an object. or array. Use the value as is.

Drop each record one at a time so that the operations
are recorded in the current transaction.

Add each record one at a time to ensure that the transaction is recorded.

#### @property scopeKey

Use this property allow NoTransaction to store a reference
to the entity upon which this data operation was performed.
This is useful when you have tables that rely on a one to one
relationship.

It is best practice use this property when ever possible,
but it not a required configuration property.


### joiner-many

`joiner-many` assumes that it represents a multiple choice question.
In order to keep the algorithm simple we drop all joiner items
that match the parent key. (i.e. SelectionID)

### one-one

`one-one` enforces referential integrity between two table in a
transaction that share a one to one relationship.  When the child
data/table as defined in the noTransaction configuration and it's
an update is performed.



Use this property to `create` new related records in a transaction
member table when a matching item does not exist. So, this also
means that no `update` operations are performed on the designated
member table.


### @method bulkUpsert

Inserts or updates and array of data items. Uses a provided
constructor to create the object that will be added to the
entity. This allows for custom data conversion and business
logic to be implement at the record level, before saving.
